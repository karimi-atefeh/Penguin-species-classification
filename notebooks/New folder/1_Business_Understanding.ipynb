    "The primary goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model to accurately classify penguin species (Adelie, Chinstrap, Gentoo) using available dataset features. The model will automate species identification, benefiting ecological research, biological studies, and conservation efforts by reducing dependency on time-consuming manual measurements.\n",

    "This project follows the CRISP-DM methodology, which provides a structured approach to solving data mining problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Available Resources**\n",
    "- **Dataset**: Palmer Penguins dataset, including biometric features (bill length, bill depth, flipper length, body mass) and additional categorical features (island and sex) [1].\n",
    "- **Tools**: Python-based machine learning libraries including Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn and Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "- **Framework**: The CRISP-DM methodology guides our structured approach to this machine learning project.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Constraints & Challenges**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The dataset might contain some missing values.\n",
    "- A balance between interpretability and classification accuracy is essential.\n",
    "- Deep learning methods are excluded; only traditional machine learning approaches will be considered.\n",

    "### <font color=\"green\">**1.3 Data Mining Goals**</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this phase, our goals are to:\n",
    "- Explore and identify key features from the dataset that distinguish penguin species.\n",
    "- Conduct research and preliminary evaluation to select suitable machine learning models from available classification techniques.\n",
    "- Evaluate selected models systematically and choose the best-performing approach based on defined metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).\n",
    "- Optimize the final selected model to ensure high reliability and interpretability.\n",

    "### <font color=\"green\">**1.4 Research Questions**</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **RQ1:** Can penguin species be accurately classified using the available features?\n",
    "- **RQ2:** Which features provide the strongest basis for distinguishing between penguin species?\n",
    "- **RQ3:** Which classification model achieves the best combination of accuracy and interpretability?\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "We follow the CRISP-DM model, tailoring it to our specific needs with the following planned tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Business Understanding**: Define objectives, assess available resources, determine goals and constraints, and formulate research questions.\n",
    "- **Data Understanding**: Collect and explore data, describe feature distributions, and identify data quality issues.\n",
    "- **Data Preparation**: Clean data, manage missing values, and prepare features for modeling.\n",
    "- **Modeling**: Research and select appropriate classification models, train and evaluate them thoroughly.\n",
    "- **Evaluation**: Assess models using defined metrics to ensure they meet project standards against success criteria and answer research questions.\n",
    "- **Deployment**: Not applicable for this project.\n",
